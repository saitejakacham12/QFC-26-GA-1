# QFC-26-GA-1 BY GP-3

A Streamlit app that lets you enter any matrix, choose a decomposition, and
watch every single calculation unfold step-by-step — exactly like Python Tutor
shows program execution, but for linear algebra.

## Features

- **Six decompositions:** LU, QR, Eigenvalue, SVD, Cholesky, PCA
- **Step-by-step visualiser:** slider through every arithmetic step with the
  exact formula used at each stage and an animated heatmap showing which cell
  was just computed
- **Matrix properties panel:** shape, rank, determinant, symmetry, positive-definiteness
- **Reconstruction check:** verifies A = factors (within floating-point tolerance)
- **PCA extras:** explained-variance bar chart per principal component
- **Download:** export any output matrix as CSV
- **Three input modes:** manual entry, CSV upload, random generation

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Notes on the merged codebase

- **A1 (Assignment1)** had better manual implementations of each algorithm
  (Gram-Schmidt QR, Banachiewicz Cholesky, QR-iteration eigenvalues) and
  richer UI with heatmaps and downloads.
- **GA1** had cleaner object-oriented structure, better error messages, and
  a nicer CSS-styled layout.
- This merged version takes the manual algorithms from A1 (educational value),
  the validation and property-checking logic from GA1, and adds the
  step-by-step visualiser and PCA on top.
